# Project #1 Part 1: Specification Based Testing

## **Introduction:**

This assignment helps you to reinforce the topics discussed in the class including:

-   Categories of testing, including equivalence partitioning, boundary value and cause and effect testing.


In this project, we have developed a database to gather information and provide discounts about a product and its users depending on a variety of factors given. The jar file with the program is given to you, but contains at least 10 seeded defects. Using equivalence partitioning, boundary value, and cause/effect analysis techniques discussed in lecture, please develop a set of test cases for this program and execute the tests. Please download the attached document below with more details on the project expectations and full details of the project.

## **Submission Instructions:**

### _Steps to Complete this Assignment_ :

1.  Complete test case matrix (Tab 1 at the bottom of the spreadsheet) from Test Case Excel Spreadsheet

2.  Execute test cases following one of the three options detailed above

3.  Report results in test case matrix tab (Pass / Fail)

4.  Complete the defect tracking sheet (Tab 2 at the bottom of the spreadsheet) containing the defect number, a brief description of each defect, and the requirement that the defect maps to. i.e.: If a user was able to input a rating > 10, the defect tracking spreadsheet entry would look like this:
