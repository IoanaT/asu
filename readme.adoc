== SSH keys

Check if any ssh keys are available:
....
ls -la ~/.ssh/
....

[NOTE]
If any keys found (_id_rsa, id_rsa.pub_) and you do not want to generate a new one, skip the next step and go to copying the public key (_.pub_) to your SSH keys in your GitHub account settings.

Generate a new SSH key:
....
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
....

Copy the contents of the file ``~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`` to your SSH keys in your GitHub account settings.

Test SSH key:
....
ssh -T git@github.com
....
You should get: +
``Hi <user-name>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.``

Change directory into the local clone of your repository (if you're not already there) and run:
....
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git
....
